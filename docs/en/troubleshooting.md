# Troubleshooting

Start with container logs:

```bash
docker logs -f icvdb-torznab
```

## WebUI does not open

- Confirm port `8000` is published.
- Check `curl 'http://localhost:8000/api?t=caps'`.
- Confirm the container uses `ghcr.io/xbit18/violarr:latest` and recreate it
  after pulling the updated image.
- A source checkout must build frontend assets before FastAPI can serve them.

## First start takes a long time

Fresh installations download, verify, inspect, and restore a PostgreSQL dump
before FastAPI starts. Follow the logs and preserve the `/data` volume between
retries.

## Prowlarr Test fails

1. Confirm the Prowlarr URL is reachable from the Violarr container.
2. If Violarr runs in Docker and Prowlarr is installed as a Windows service on
   the host machine, Docker Desktop can normally reach it at
   `http://host.docker.internal:9696`.
3. If both applications run as containers on the same Docker network, use the
   service name, for example `http://prowlarr:9696`.
4. Confirm the API key in Prowlarr under **Settings → General → Security**.

## Prowlarr cannot add Violarr

If **Test connection** succeeds but **Add Violarr to Prowlarr** fails, the
Violarr → Prowlarr connection is working. The problem is usually in the opposite
direction: Prowlarr → Violarr.

- If Prowlarr runs on the same Windows host and Violarr publishes port `8000`,
  normally use `http://localhost:8000/api`.
- If both applications run as containers on the same Docker network, use
  `http://icvdb-torznab:8000/api`.
- The URL must end with `/api`.
- Check the detail shown in the WebUI, the browser console, and the Prowlarr
  logs.

## Expected releases are missing

- `italian_only` and custom exclusion rules are hard filters.
- Ranking is local to 1000-row database windows.
- Result processing cannot guarantee Radarr/Sonarr selection.
- Switch back to `unfiltered` to compare the original database order.

## Update is temporarily unavailable

HTTP `503` with `Retry-After: 5` is expected during the short database switch.
Persistent updater errors appear on the WebUI dashboard and in logs. The active
database remains unchanged for failures before the switch.

## Settings do not match the saved file

Check [environment variables](./configuration/environment). Runtime overrides
win over persisted values without rewriting `settings.json`.
